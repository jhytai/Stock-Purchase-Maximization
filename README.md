## How to run the program ##

* The programming language used is C++.
* The executable file is already compiled to run from a Linux terminal.
* If needed, you can recompile again from a Linux terminal by using the command
    - $g++ main.cpp -o StockPurchaseMaximization
    - Also your compiler should support C++11 or newer standard
* To run the executable file from a Linux terminal, use the command
    - $./StockPurchaseMaximization
* The console log output is being redirected to a console_log.txt file.
* The program reads input from a input.txt file.
* The output results are saved in a output.txt file.
