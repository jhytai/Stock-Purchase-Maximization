## How to run the program ##

* The programming language used is C++.
* The executable file is already compiled to run from a Linux terminal.
* If needed, you can recompile again from a Linux terminal by using the command
    - $g++ main.cpp -o StockPurchaseMaximization
    - Also your compiler should support C++11 or newer standard
* To run the executable file from a Linux terminal, use the command
    - $./StockPurchaseMaximization
* The console log output is being redirected to a console_log.txt file.
* The program reads input from a input.txt file.
    - Each case is represented by 3 lines, and a newline should separate each case.
    - In each case, the first line represents the number of companies (N), the second line represents quantity of stocks and their total value as a pair of values (s,v) using the notation of an array of arrays, the third line represents the amount available for investment (M).
    - Only integer values are accepted.
* The output results are saved in a output.txt file.
    - The output for each case is represented by one single line containing the max amount of stocks that is possible to purchase on each case. And a newline separates each case.
* An 'input.txt' file is provided with 10 sample cases, and the respective 'output.txt' and 'console_log.txt' for running the program with this sample 'input.txt' file.
    - Sample case input:
    - Expected sample case output:
